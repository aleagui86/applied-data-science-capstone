# Decoding SpaceX: An Applied Data Science Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for analyzing SpaceX launch data using various data science techniques. The project is structured into several stages as follows:

## Stages

1. **Collecting Data from SpaceX API**
   - Description: In this stage, we collect data from the SpaceX API, which provides information about launches, rockets, and other related data.

2. **Web Scraping Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy Launch Records from Wikipedia**
   - Description: This stage involves scraping launch records for Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets from Wikipedia. We extract relevant data such as launch dates, mission outcomes, and landing outcomes.

3. **Data Wrangling and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Description: Here, we clean and preprocess the collected data. We perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into launch trends, success rates, and other patterns.

4. **Interactive Visual Analytics with Folium**
   - Description: Utilizing Folium, we create interactive maps to visualize launch locations, landing sites, and other geographical data related to SpaceX launches.

5. **Interactive Dashboard Application with Plotly Dash**
   - Description: This stage involves building an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash. The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface to explore SpaceX launch data, view statistics, and visualize trends.

6. **First Stage Landing Prediction**
   - Description: Using machine learning techniques, we develop a model to predict the likelihood of successful first stage landings for SpaceX rocket launches based on various factors such as weather conditions, payload mass, and launch location.

## Instructions

Detailed instructions for running each stage of the project can be found in the respective directories. Please refer to the README files within each stage directory for setup instructions, dependencies, and execution guidelines.
